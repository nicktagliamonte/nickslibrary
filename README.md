## Notes
A release is included, so it is technically possible to download the jar and use these if you really wanted.  
Primarily the structures exist for the sake of my having created them and they are largely less efficient or useful than the structures you'd get from java.util, so there's not really any benefit to actually using these.  
Tests are available in the test folder for most of the structures, but as I progressed into the more niche end of Advance/Other, testing was largely done locally in main or even in the files themselves and deleted after they passed.
